## How to Use
- Download one of the folders. Each one contains a different server.
- Edit the run.sh file such that it points to your Java installation.
- Download a server.jar
  - Any spigot-based server works but I use [Paper](https://papermc.io/) for my servers
  - I use [paper-1.8.8](https://papermc.io/downloads/all) for my bedwars and ballwars servers
- Rename the file to server.jar and place it into the server folder.
- Run run.sh

## Differences between My Bedwars and Hypixel Bedwars:
I tried to make it as close to normal bedwars as possible
- Click the sign to join the game, or type `/bw join` (`/bedwars join`)
- The server has one map/one game at a time
- There is no sudden death 
- Bots can be added but they're practically useless

__Maps:__
- Ruins (2 islands)
- Invasion (4 islands)
- Lighthouse (8 islands)

__Resources:__
- Iron spawns 1 per second
- Gold spawns 1 per 8 seconds
- Diamonds spawn 1 per 30 seconds
- Emeralds spawn 1 per minute 

__Shop:__
- Fireballs aren't as accurate (sniping is impossible)
- Fireball jumping is different
  - Fireballing straight down sends you extremely high
  - I tried tweaking this for a long time to make it similar to Hypixel
- Spamming fireballs or throwing while running may cause them to hit you
- Fireballs destroy stone (they use the same logic as TNT) and spash through blocks
  - This means covering blocks in glass won't work
- Water costs 6 gold
- Silverfish don't exist
- The only potions are invis and instant heal (1 emerald)
- You can only set the bottom row of quick buy
- Iron golems are weak
- You can directly buy any level tools
  - Tools (usually) downgrade 1 level (until wood) upon death

__Team Upgrade Shop:__
- Forge costs 2 diamonds per level and increases base resource generation by +33% per level, up to +100%
- Mining fatigue trap costs 2 diamonds for balance
- Counter-offense trap gives jump boost and regen

## Differences between My Bedwars and Ballwars
- Iron spawns 1 every 2 seconds (instead of every second)
- Fireballs cost 3 iron (instead of 40 iron)
- Bridge eggs cost 6 gold (instead of 1 emerald)
- Glass costs 2 gold for 4 glass
  - It is recommended to cover your bed using 4 gold (8 glass)
